The DICT is a dictionary network protocol (OSI layer 7 - Application Layer) that is described by the [RFC 2229](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2229.html). 
The protocol defines a collection of commands that a server must be able to recognize, 
so the client can access the available data and be able to lookup the word definitions based on different languages.
